## About Me

I am definitely someone that considers myself a problem solver and working with my hands, which is why I love carpentry and creating little projects for myself. I used to do it as a side business but now I do it just for fun.

Another one of my interests is providing help for missionary work in Africa, collaborating with local church leaders to spread the word of God and providing help for those in need. One of my goals is to definitely be able to work remotely while fullfilling my passion abroad.
