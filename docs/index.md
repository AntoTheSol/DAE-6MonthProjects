## Future Goals

Hey nice to meet you all, I'm Gabe and I'm studying Cyber Security specifcally looking into starting as an SOC Analyst. A little about myself is I consider myself a hands on individual as it's always been the best way I learn and get things done and I look forward to learning as much as I can within the cyber security industry.

My current goal is to be a Security Operations Centre (SOC) Analyst, where as a crucial frontline cyber security professional I will be responsible for monitoring, detecting, analysing, and swiftly responding to cyber threats to safeguard an organisation's networks and valuable data.

I believe in a strong team-based work environment, where we can all work with each other and compliment our strengths and weaknesses. I know that I will definitely shine in a group bringing new insight as a team member.

## About Me

I am definitely someone that considers myself a problem solver and working with my hands, which is why I love carpentry and creating little projects for myself. I used to do it as a side business but now I do it just for fun.

Another one of my interests is providing help for missionary work in Africa, collaborating with local church leaders to spread the word of God and providing help for those in need. One of my goals is to definitely be able to work remotely while fullfilling my passion abroad.

## Expected Graduation

October 2025
