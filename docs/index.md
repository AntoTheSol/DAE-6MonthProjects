## About Me

Hey nice to meet you visitors, I'm Gabe and I'm studying Cyber Security specifcally looking into starting as an SOC Analyst. A little about myself is I consider myself a hands on individual as it's always been the best way I learn and get things done and I look forward to learning as much as I can within the cyber security industry.
