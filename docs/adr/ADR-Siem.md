# Architecture Decision Record (ADR) - SIEM

## Title

Implementation of Wazuh as Primary SIEM Solution for Security Monitoring

## Context

• Our cybersecurity lab requires comprehensive security information and event management capabilities

• Need for real-time monitoring, log analysis, and incident response coordination

• Budget constraints require cost-effective solution without compromising security features

• Must support multiple operating systems and provide threat detection capabilities

• Integration with existing infrastructure and future scalability requirements


## Decision

Implement Wazuh as the primary SIEM solution for our security monitoring infrastructure.

## Rationale

• **Open Source**: No licensing costs, full access to source code for customization

• **Comprehensive Features**: 

  - File integrity monitoring (FIM)
  - Intrusion detection system (IDS)
  - Vulnerability assessment
  - Compliance monitoring (PCI DSS, HIPAA, NIST)

• **Multi-platform Support**: Supports Windows, Linux, macOS, and mobile platforms

• **Active Community**: Strong community support and regular updates

• **Scalability**: Can handle small to enterprise-level deployments

• **Integration Capabilities**: APIs for custom integrations and third-party tools


## Alternatives Considered

• **Splunk**: Rejected due to high licensing costs and complexity for small-scale deployment

• **IBM QRadar**: Rejected due to expensive licensing and resource requirements

• **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**: Rejected due to lack of built-in security rules

• **AlienVault OSSIM**: Rejected due to discontinued community support

• **Suricata + ELK**: Rejected due to increased complexity of managing multiple components


## Consequences

### Positive

• Significant cost savings compared to commercial solutions

• Full control over configuration and customization

• Comprehensive security monitoring capabilities

• Strong documentation and community support

• Easy integration with our VirtualBox lab environment


### Negative

• Requires more hands-on configuration than commercial solutions

• Limited official enterprise support options

• Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with open-source tools

• Responsibility for maintaining and updating the system internally
