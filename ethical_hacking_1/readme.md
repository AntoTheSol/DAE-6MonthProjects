**Installation Steps:**

**Step 1: Download Parrot OS**
```
Source: https://www.parrotsec.org/download/
Version: Parrot Security 6.0 (Home/Security Edition)
File: Parrot-security-6.0_amd64.iso
Size: ~4.5GB
```

**Step 2: Create Virtual Machine**

```

- Memory: 4096 MB
- Hard Disk: 40 GB (VDI, Dynamically allocated)
- Processors: 2 CPUs
- Video Memory: 128 MB
- Enable 3D Acceleration: Yes
```

**Step 3: Network Configuration**

| Adapter | Type | Purpose | Settings |
|---------|------|---------|----------|
| Adapter 1 | NAT | Internet access | Default |
| Adapter 2 | Host-Only | Isolated lab network | vboxnet0 (192.168.56.0/24) |

**Network Configuration Commands:**
```bash
# After installation, verify network interfaces
ip addr show

# Configure static IP for host-only adapter
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces

# Add configuration:
auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
    address 192.168.56.10
    netmask 255.255.255.0

# Restart networking
sudo systemctl restart networking
```

**Installation Evidence:**

```bash
# System Information
cat /etc/os-release
# Output:
# NAME="Parrot OS"
# VERSION="6.0 (LoroKeet)"
# ID=parrot
# ID_LIKE=debian

# Network verification
ip addr show
# eth0: NAT network (10.0.2.15/24)
# eth1: Host-Only network (192.168.56.10/24)

# Connectivity test
ping -c 4 8.8.8.8          # Internet connectivity via NAT
ping -c 4 192.168.56.1     # Host machine connectivity
```

**Screenshots Required:**
- VirtualBox VM settings showing CPU, RAM, and storage allocation
- Network adapter configuration (NAT + Host-Only)

### 1.2 Essential Tool Installation & Configuration

**Tool Installation Commands:**

```bash
# Update system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install Nmap (if not pre-installed)
sudo apt install nmap -y

# Install Wireshark
sudo apt install wireshark -y
sudo usermod -aG wireshark $USER
# Logout/login required for group changes

# Install Metasploit Framework
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rapid7/metasploit-omnibus/master/config/templates/metasploit-framework-wrappers/msfupdate.erb > msfinstall
chmod 755 msfinstall
sudo ./msfinstall
```

**1.2.1 Nmap Configuration**

```bash
# Verify installation
nmap --version
# Expected: Nmap version 7.94+

# Test basic scan
nmap -sV localhost

# Create custom scan script
mkdir -p ~/security-tools/nmap-scripts
nano ~/security-tools/nmap-scripts/quick-scan.sh
```

**quick-scan.sh:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Quick network scan script
TARGET=$1
echo "Scanning target: $TARGET"
nmap -sV -sC -O -oN scan_results_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).txt $TARGET
```

**1.2.2 Wireshark Configuration**

```bash
# Verify installation
wireshark --version

# Configure capture permissions
sudo dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common
# Select "Yes" for non-superusers

# Test packet capture
sudo wireshark
# Select eth0 interface
# Start capture
# Generate traffic: ping 8.8.8.8
# Stop capture and verify packets visible
```

**Wireshark Display Filters (Essential):**
```
http                    # HTTP traffic only
tcp.port == 80          # Traffic on port 80
ip.addr == 192.168.1.1  # Traffic to/from specific IP
dns                     # DNS queries
icmp                    # ICMP/ping traffic
```

**1.2.3 Metasploit Framework Configuration**

```bash
# Initialize Metasploit database
sudo msfdb init

# Start Metasploit console
msfconsole

# Inside msfconsole:
msf6 > db_status
# Output: [*] Connected to msf. Connection type: postgresql.

# Update Metasploit
msf6 > msfupdate

# Test with auxiliary module
msf6 > use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/portscan/tcp) > set RHOSTS 127.0.0.1
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/portscan/tcp) > set PORTS 1-1000
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/portscan/tcp) > run
```

### 1.6 Secure Lab Environment with Isolation

**Lab Security Configuration:**

**1. Network Isolation**

```bash
# Host-Only network provides isolation from production network
# Verify isolation:

# From Parrot VM, should NOT be able to reach production network:
ping -c 2 192.168.1.1    # Production network (should fail)

# Should be able to reach:
ping -c 2 192.168.56.1   # Host machine (should succeed)
ping -c 2 8.8.8.8        # Internet via NAT (should succeed)
```

**2. VirtualBox Snapshot Configuration**

```bash
# Create clean baseline snapshot
VBoxManage snapshot "Parrot-Security-Lab" take "Clean_Baseline" \
  --description "Fresh installation with tools configured"

# List snapshots
VBoxManage snapshot "Parrot-Security-Lab" list

# Restore snapshot if needed
VBoxManage snapshot "Parrot-Security-Lab" restore "Clean_Baseline"
```

**3. Firewall Configuration**

```bash
# Configure UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
sudo ufw enable

# Allow SSH from host-only network only
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.56.0/24 to any port 22

# Deny all other incoming by default
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing

# Verify rules
sudo ufw status verbose
```

**4. Lab Environment Checklist:**

- [ ] VM uses isolated Host-Only network for lab activities
- [ ] Production network is not accessible from VM
- [ ] Baseline snapshot created before testing
- [ ] Firewall configured with restrictive rules
- [ ] Test targets are isolated (vulnerable VMs in same Host-Only network)
- [ ] No production systems in scan scope
- [ ] Tools configured with safe default settings
