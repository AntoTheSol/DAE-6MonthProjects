# STAR Method for Interviewing

Describe a time when you were responsible for a task you didn't receive training on and were unsure how to complete. How did you handle it?

## Situation(S)
What was happening? What problem or need existed?

When I was at UCONN I was assigned with a group of student who all had different engineering backgrounds to help conduct a survey for a blast media facility at the groton national guard airbase

## Task(T)
What were you responsible for? 

I wasn't sure exactly what the project entailed but it seemed to involve using all of our different disciplines in engineering to help construct a blast facility which strips the paint of helicopters.

## Action(A)

I took the initiative to reach out to the major of the base and explain our issues with the project but also how we can better deliver what was expected of us. He decided to make me point man on the project and I relayed what the major told to the rest of my group, and I suggested we break down and organize the research and documentation on different aspects of the blast facility and what was required to achive our goals.

## Results (R)

At the end we had a polished schedule set up and were able to complete our deliverables on time.
