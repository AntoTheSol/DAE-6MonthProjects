I like the app. I only have one suggestion and that is to add a drop down for the ategory as its confusing while adding the transaction. Also Users might not remmeber what categories they put in. So Add a Constant categories like Food, Travel, Outing etc and also an option to add custom categories and then can have a drop down in the transactoin page so its easy for user to select one.
If there is no category in the budget from teh transaction page it should not add a transaction
If its a expense add (-) before the number and (+) for income or even as you said green and red color.
