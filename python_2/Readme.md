# Python 2

This DAE folder is used to grade my coding competency and to display my ability to use python structure and practices.



Criteria

Constant Usage in Variables
Define and apply a constant within the code using a descriptive name.

Decision Structures with if-else
Construct an if-else statement to direct the flow of execution based on a condition.

Repetition with while Loops
Use a while loop to execute code repeatedly based on a boolean condition.

Sequence Iteration with for Loops
Code a for loop to systematically iterate over a range or collection.

Function Creation and Utilization
Write functions that require one or multiple arguments and include at least one function that returns a computed value.

List Manipulation and Iteration
Access and manipulate individual elements in a list and use loops to perform operations on each element.

Incomplete
File Operations
Implement code to efficiently read data from a file and to write data to a file.

Exception Handling
Utilize a try clause to attempt code execution, manage exceptions with an except clause, use an else clause for code that runs if no exceptions occur, and include a finally clause to execute code regardless of the previous clauses' results.
