### 1. Implement and Explain Advanced Cybersecurity Defense Strategies  

#### 1.1 Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)  
- **Definition:** A security framework that requires continuous verification of users, devices, and applications, regardless of location within or outside the network perimeter.  
- **Implementation Example:**  
  1. **Identity Layer:** Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all VPN logins.  
  2. **Network Layer:** Require device posture validation (up-to-date patches, endpoint protection enabled) before granting access to internal resources.  
- **Result:** Access is not granted based on network location alone, but on verified trust at multiple layers.

### 1.2 Defense in Depth (DiD)  
- **Definition:** A layered security approach where multiple security controls are implemented across the IT environment to reduce risk.  
- **Example System Architecture with 3 Layers:**  
  1. **Perimeter Layer:** Firewall + Intrusion Detection System (IDS).  
  2. **Host Layer:** Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) with real-time monitoring.  
  3. **Application/Data Layer:** Database encryption and role-based access control (RBAC).  
- **Result:** Even if one defense fails (e.g., firewall bypass), additional layers continue to protect assets.

### 1.3 Supply Chain Security  
- **Definition:** Protecting systems from vulnerabilities or compromises introduced via third-party vendors, software, or hardware.  
- **Example of Risk Identification and Mitigation:**  
  - **Risk:** Open-source library used in a web app contains a known vulnerability (e.g., Log4j exploit).  
  - **Mitigation:**  
    - Perform regular dependency scanning (e.g., with OWASP Dependency-Check, GitHub Dependabot).  
    - Apply vendor patches and update vulnerable components immediately.  
    - Implement Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) tracking.  
- **Result:** Ensures that third-party risks are detected early and mitigated before exploitation.

- Deploy forensic tools (Autopsy, Volatility3, Magnet RAM Capture) on analyst workstation.  
- Maintain updated IR playbooks for malware, insider threats, and brute-force incidents.  
- Ensure logging enabled across endpoints and SIEM is actively monitored.  

**2.1b Identification**  
- Detect suspicious activity via SIEM alert (e.g., abnormal login attempts, data exfiltration).  
- Acquire volatile evidence using **Magnet RAM Capture** and store in raw `.raw` dump format.  
- Use **Volatility3** or **Volatility Workbench** to analyze memory dump for malicious processes, DLL injection, or network connections.  

**2.1c Containment**  
- Isolate compromised system from production network.  
- Disable affected accounts or credentials.  
- Block identified malicious IPs at firewall.  

**2.1d Eradication**  
- Remove identified malware artifacts discovered through Autopsy or Volatility3 plugin analysis.  
- Patch exploited vulnerabilities on affected systems.  
- Re-image compromised endpoints if necessary.  

**2.1e Recovery**  
- Restore system from clean backups.  
- Re-enable accounts after credential resets.  
- Monitor for recurrence using enhanced SIEM correlation rules.  

---

### 2.2 Digital Forensics Basics Demonstration
- **Tool 1: Magnet RAM Capture** – Used to acquire volatile memory from the suspect machine. Output stored securely for analysis.  
- **Tool 2: Volatility3** – Used to analyze the memory dump for suspicious processes, loaded drivers, and persistence mechanisms.  
- **Tool 3: Volatility Workbench** - A lite version of Volatility3 which has a GUI interface and can scan raw data files which contain ram memory dumps. An example of information which can be gleamed are hidden malicious processes which might not appear normally in the windows processes screen.
- **Tool 4: Autopsy** – Applied for disk-level analysis and correlation of logs, file metadata, and deleted artifacts.

  00:30 UTC – Verified and logged into Autopsy case file
Signatures: Analyst A, SOC Lead
```

---

### 2.5 Incident Triage and Prioritization

**Incident Type 1 – Brute Force Attack (FTP)**  
- **Severity:** Medium  
- **Impact:** Repeated failed login attempts indicate attempted unauthorized access.  
- **Business Impact:** May lead to account compromise if not addressed, but immediate damage is limited.  

**Incident Type 2 – Malware Execution (Ransomware Simulation)**  
- **Severity:** High  
- **Impact:** Rapid file encryption and modification cause significant risk of downtime and data loss.  
- **Business Impact:** Direct operational disruption, potential financial and reputational harm.  

**Incident Type 3 – Policy Violation (Unauthorized Access Attempt)**  
- **Severity:** Low  
- **Impact:** Attempts were blocked by existing access control mechanisms.  
- **Business Impact:** Minimal, but requires monitoring for repeat offenders or insider threat signals.  

---

### 2.6 Post-Incident Analysis

**2.6a Incident Outcome Summary**  
- Forensic analysis confirmed suspicious activity including brute-force login attempts and exfiltration of sensitive files (`ransomAttack.py`, `wazuh_rules.md`).  
- Wazuh agent connectivity issues created blind spots during attacker activity.  
- The incident was contained by disabling the compromised FTP account and isolating the affected host.  

**2.6b Lessons Learned**  
1. **Improve Monitoring Reliability:** Configure redundant agent health checks and alerts to immediately flag when monitoring agents disconnect.  
2. **Enhance Forensic Readiness:** Maintain a pre-staged toolkit (Magnet RAM Capture, Volatility3, Autopsy) to ensure evidence collection begins within minutes of incident detection.

1. **Tier 1 Analyst (Monitoring & Triage):**  
   - Monitors SIEM dashboards for alerts.  
   - Performs initial triage to identify false positives vs. real incidents.  
   - Escalates suspicious alerts to Tier 2.  

2. **Tier 2 Analyst (Incident Investigation):**  
   - Performs deeper investigation using forensic tools (Autopsy, Volatility3, Sysmon logs).  
   - Correlates multiple data sources (Windows Event Logs, FileZilla logs, Wazuh alerts).  
   - Contains incidents and prepares escalation for critical events.  

3. **SOC Manager (Oversight & Coordination):**  
   - Defines escalation paths and response workflows.  
   - Ensures SOC metrics (MTTD, MTTR) are met.  
   - Provides reporting to executive leadership and compliance teams.  

---

### 3.2 Monitoring Fundamentals  

**3.2a Configured Monitoring Tool:**  
- **Tool Used:** Wazuh SIEM (open-source Security Information and Event Management).  
- **Configuration Steps:**  
  - Installed Wazuh Agent on Windows 11 endpoint.  
  - Configured `ossec.conf` to forward Windows Event Logs, Sysmon data, and FileZilla logs.  
  - Enabled JSON output and set alert thresholds at rule level ≥7.  

**3.2b Network Activity Monitored:**  
1. **FTP Activity (FileZilla Logs):**  
   - Monitoring file uploads/downloads (`RETR`, `STOR`) and login attempts.  
   - Example: Exfiltration of `ransomAttack.py`.  
2. **Windows Sysmon Network Connections:**  
   - Monitoring for unusual outbound connections or traffic to non-standard ports.  
   - Example: Event ID 3 showed suspicious UDP traffic to multicast address `224.0.0.251`.  

---

#### 3.3 Alert Management  

**Wazuh Ruleset Used for FTP Monitoring:**  

```xml
<group name="ftp,windows,">
  <rule id="100120" level="6">
    <match>530 Login incorrect</match>
    <description>FTP login failed on Windows (FileZilla)</description>
  </rule>
  
  <rule id="100121" level="5">
    <match>230 Login successful</match>
    <description>FTP login successful on Windows (FileZilla)</description>
  </rule>
</group>

<group name="ftp,bruteforce">
  <rule id="100123" level="10" frequency="6" timeframe="30">
    <if_matched_sid>100120</if_matched_sid>
    <description>Multiple login failures detected (FTP Brute Force Attempt)</description>
  </rule>
</group>
```

**Alert 1 – FTP Brute Force Attempt**  
- **Generated:** Triggered by repeated `530 Login incorrect` entries in FileZilla logs.  
- **Investigated:** Correlated with Wazuh ruleset (`frequency="5" timeframe="60"`) to confirm brute force.  
- **Resolved:** Account locked, firewall rule applied to block source IP.  

![Wazuh_Events7_FTP_Bruteforce](img/Wazuh_Events7_FTP_Bruteforce.png)

**Alert 2 – File Exfiltration Detected**  
- **Generated:** Wazuh rule triggered on `RETR ransomAttack.py` event from FileZilla logs.  
- **Investigated:** Volatility3 analysis of RAM dump confirmed process responsible for FTP session.  
- **Resolved:** FTP account disabled, endpoint isolated from network.  

![Wazuh_FTPAdvancedAlerts](img/Wazuh_FTPAdvancedAlerts.png)

---

### 3.4 Basic Threat Detection  

**Threat Identified:** Malicious file exfiltration via FTP (`ransomAttack.py`, `wazuh_rules.md`).  
- **Detection Method:**  
  - FileZilla logs captured `RETR` operations.  
  - Wazuh correlation rule flagged the events.  
  - Sysmon confirmed process execution linked to FTP session.  
- **SOC Workflow:**  
  1. Tier 1 Analyst triaged the initial Wazuh alert.  
  2. Tier 2 Analyst verified the activity in FileZilla logs and RAM dump.  
  3. Incident escalated and containment executed.
