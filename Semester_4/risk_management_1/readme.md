Risk Management Fundamentals

Create a project risk framework document using NIST RMF or ISO 31000 standards with proper risk terminology (threat, vulnerability, asset, control) applied to a realistic scenario. Develop governance structure documentation showing roles, responsibilities, and decision-making authority with escalation procedures. Include regulatory compliance matrix for one industry (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, or PCI-DSS) and visual framework mapping showing organizational alignment. Documentation must be professional quality with clear formatting suitable for executive presentation.
	
Risk Assessment Techniques

Conduct structured risk identification using three methods (brainstorming, checklists, SWOT analysis) with documented facilitation approach. Apply qualitative analysis using 5x5 risk matrix with likelihood and impact scales, plus quantitative analysis including EMV and ALE calculations with supporting data. Complete threat and vulnerability assessment with documented findings and create comprehensive risk register with scoring rationale and historical tracking capabilities.

Risk Evaluation Methods

Develop multi-criteria risk scoring model using weighted evaluation factors (financial, operational, compliance, reputation) with defined measurement scales. Perform Business Impact Analysis including RTO, RPO, and MTD calculations with financial impact analysis and dependency mapping. Document evaluation criteria with stakeholder approval and create critical asset risk exposure register showing threat exposure, vulnerabilities, and interconnection dependencies with professional formatting.

Risk Mitigation Planning

Select and document controls using industry frameworks (NIST Cybersecurity Framework, ISO 27001) with detailed rationale and cost-benefit analysis. Document risk treatment options for all four strategies (mitigate, avoid, transfer, accept) with implementation timelines and resource requirements. Develop comprehensive mitigation strategy aligned with business objectives and calculate residual risk after control implementation with effectiveness measurements and monitoring procedures.

Risk Communication

Create structured executive risk report with key findings, financial impact analysis, and actionable recommendations formatted for board presentation. Develop stakeholder communication plan with audience analysis, tailored messaging, and communication schedules. Design visual risk dashboard with key metrics, automated alerting, and drill-down capabilities, plus implement KPI framework with leading/lagging indicators and tracking systems with documented review processes.
	
Risk Management Implementation

Develop complete risk management program plan with realistic implementation timelines, resource allocation, and phase-based deployment strategy. Implement chosen framework (NIST RMF, ISO 31000, COSO) with documented customization, gap analysis, and integration procedures. Create comprehensive risk register with historical tracking and establish continuous monitoring system with automated indicators, threshold alerting, and environmental change detection capabilities for ongoing program management.
