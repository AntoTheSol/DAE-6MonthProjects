# Logic 1

This DAE folder is for my project 1 Flow Chart for my budget tracker, it was created with FIGMA and shows the logic of my particular program before I started coding.


Criteria

Craft Algorithms
Numbered algorithm (6+ steps) that seamlessly integrates decision-making using simple Boolean and conditional cues.

Visualize with Flowcharts
Detailed flowchart that mirrors the algorithm's structure, including its Boolean and conditional elements, using at least five distinct symbols: Start, Stop, and three others.

Incorporate Boolean Logic
Clear representation of Boolean decision points in the flowchart that align with the algorithm's structure.

Apply Conditional Logic
Representation of 'If' conditions in the flowchart that are consistent with the algorithm's decision structure.
