# Comprehensive Malware Analysis Report

**File SHA-256:** `8301936f439f43579cffe98e11e3224051e2fb890ffe9df680bbbd8db0729387`

---

## Detection Results

### VirusTotal

- **Detection Rate:** 10 / 70 antivirus engines flagged the file.
- **Notable Detections:**
  - `Trojan:Win32/Emotet`
  - `Trojan.GenericKD.48805871`
  - `W32/Emotet.B.gen!Eldorado`

> These detections suggest association with the Emotet malware family, known for distributing other malware and spam campaigns.

---

## Behavioral Indicators

### VirusTotal

- **Network Activity:** Attempts to establish connections with remote servers, often for command and control purposes.
- **Persistence Mechanisms:** Modifies system settings to ensure it remains active after system reboots.
- **Payload Delivery:** Downloads and executes additional malicious payloads, such as ransomware or information stealers.
- **Email Propagation:** Spreads via malicious email attachments or links, often masquerading as legitimate documents.

### CAPE Sandbox

- **Execution Behavior:** The file was executed in a controlled environment to observe its behavior.
- **Network Activity:** Established connections to external servers, indicating potential command and control communication.
- **File System Changes:** Created or modified files in system directories, suggesting attempts to maintain persistence.
- **Registry Modifications:** Altered registry keys to ensure execution on system startup.

> These behaviors align with typical characteristics of the Emotet malware family.

---

## Potential Impact

- **Data Theft:** Harvests sensitive information, including login credentials and personal data.
- **System Compromise:** Creates backdoors, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to the infected system.
- **Lateral Movement:** Once inside a network, Emotet can spread to other systems, increasing the scope of the attack.
- **Financial Loss:** Facilitates the delivery of other malicious payloads, leading to significant financial losses through fraud or data breaches.

---

## Recommendations

- **Immediate Action:** If this file is detected on your system, isolate the affected machine to prevent further spread.
- **Antivirus Scan:** Run a full system scan using reputable antivirus software to detect and remove any associated threats.
- **Update Systems:** Ensure that all software, including the operating system and applications, are up to date with the latest security patches.
- **Monitor Network Traffic:** Look for unusual outbound connections that may indicate communication with malicious servers.
- **User Awareness:** Educate users about the dangers of opening unsolicited email attachments or clicking on unknown links.

## **Phishing Simulation**

Using the Social Engineering Toolkit we can simulate a phishing attack

We would type sudo su in terminal and then setoolkit

### APT Campaign Mapping*

üéØ 1. MintsLoader

A cybercriminal loader-as-a-service group that distributes payloads via compromised websites, typosquatted domains, malicious ads, and phishing-like campaigns.
Notably, they've deployed StealC as part of their malware payloads in PPI (pay‚Äëper‚Äëinstall) schemes 
misp-galaxy.org


üéØ 2. ‚ÄúTusk‚Äù (Russian-speaking cybercriminal cluster)

This group operates a multifaceted info‚Äëstealer campaign using social-engineered phishing sites impersonating brands, game launchers, etc.
Its multi‚Äëstage downloader infrastructure has delivered StealC alongside other stealers like DanaBot 

Initial Access ‚Üí Phishing (T1566)
Execution and Persistence ‚Üí Fileless loaders
Credential Access ‚Üí StealC behavior

Map their techniques using ATT&CK TIDs:
T1566 ‚Äì Phishing
T1204 ‚Äì User Execution
T1003 ‚Äì Credential Access
T1071/T1041 ‚Äì C2 & Exfiltration
