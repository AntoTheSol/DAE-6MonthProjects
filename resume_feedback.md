Matt
- resume looks really complete and concise. All the necessary components are included and it is very organized and structured really well. Not sure if you wanted to include your LinkedIn profile, but you could potentially add that if you want to, but other than that small piece of feedback, it looks really good.

Craig
- Alter the wording to be more professional

Javier
- Good formatting
- update information with current work and program
