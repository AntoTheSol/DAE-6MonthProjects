## SOC Analyst Job Description

A **Security Operations Centre (SOC) Analyst** is a crucial frontline professional responsible for monitoring, detecting, analysing, and swiftly responding to cyber threats to safeguard an organisation's networks and valuable data.

Main Project: Simulated SOC Incident Response & Analysis Lab
This project simulates a real-world cyber incident within a controlled environment, allowing you to demonstrate your capabilities across several critical SOC functions. Goal: To detect, analyse, and respond to a simulated cyberattack within a small, self-built network, documenting every step. Approximate Time Allocation: Dedicate the majority of your 1-3 months (e.g., 60-70% of your time) to this comprehensive project.

**Steps and Key Learnings:**

1. **Environment Setup (Foundational, ~1-2 weeks):**

- Set up a virtual lab: This is foundational. You'll need virtual machines (VMs) for a "target" Windows host, a "target" Linux host, and a "SOC Analyst Workstation" (e.g., Kali Linux or a Linux distribution with security tools). The sources highlight the importance of understanding Windows and Linux environments.

- Configure a SIEM: Install and configure a free or community edition SIEM tool like Elastic SIEM (ELK Stack) or Splunk Free. Learn to ingest logs from your Windows and Linux VMs (e.g., Windows Event Logs, Linux Syslogs) and basic network devices. This is the "backbone" of your SOC.

(Note: Setting up VMs and basic networking is general IT knowledge not explicitly detailed in the sources as a project step, but is implied by the tools and environment mentioned).

2. **Simulated Attack & Initial Detection (~2-3 weeks):**

- Simulate a common attack: Choose a simple attack, like a brute-force login attempt, a basic malware infection (using a safe sample in an isolated VM), or a simulated data exfiltration. This could involve using a basic ethical hacking tool from Kali Linux (e.g., Hydra for brute-force).

- Monitor and identify alerts: Act as a Tier 1 SOC Analyst. Use your configured SIEM to monitor the logs for suspicious activities and alerts generated by the simulated attack.

3. **In-Depth Investigation & Analysis (~3-4 weeks):**

- Log Forensics: As a Tier 2 analyst, delve into the Windows Event Logs and Linux Syslogs to identify signs of the attack. Learn to query and interpret common event IDs.

- Network Traffic Analysis: Use Wireshark to capture and analyse network packets during the simulated attack. Identify unusual patterns, protocols, or data transfers that indicate malicious activity.

- Threat Intelligence Gathering: Use open-source intelligence (OSINT) tools like VirusTotal or AlienVault OTX to gather information on any detected malicious IPs, domains, or file hashes. Show how threat intelligence enriches your understanding of the incident.

- Malware Analysis (if applicable): If you simulated a malware infection, use a sandbox environment (eg., Cuckoo Sandbox or Any.Run) and tools like Ghidra or IDA Pro to perform a basic analysis of the malware's behaviour and extract Indicators of Compromise (IOCs). 

4. **Incident Response & Documentation (~2-3 weeks):**

- Develop and implement response strategies: Outline and execute steps for containment, eradication, and recovery. This might involve isolating compromised systems or modifying simulated firewall rules.

- Comprehensive Reporting: This is critical for shining. Create a detailed incident report that explains the entire process: what happened, how it was detected, the investigation steps, findings (IOCs), the impact, and the remediation actions taken. Include screenshots and clear explanations.

5. **Automation (Stretch Goal/Enhancement):**

- Scripting for efficiency: Write a small Python or Bash script to automate a repetitive task within your project, such as parsing specific log entries for patterns, or automating the collection of certain system artifacts. This demonstrates advanced thinking and efficiency.
Side Project Option 1: Advanced SIEM Use Case Development
This project deepens your expertise in SIEM, a fundamental tool for SOC Analysts. Goal: To design, implement, and test custom SIEM rules and dashboards for a specific, non-obvious security use case. Approximate Time Allocation: Dedicate around 15-20% of your time.
Steps and Key Learnings:

1. Identify a unique threat scenario: Go beyond simple failed logins. Think about more complex attack patterns like lateral movement (e.g., a legitimate account accessing multiple unusual internal systems) or privilege escalation attempts.
2. Develop correlation rules: Using your chosen SIEM (Splunk, QRadar, Elastic SIEM), write custom correlation rules that combine multiple log events over time to detect this specific threat scenario.
3. Create a dashboard: Design an intuitive dashboard within the SIEM that visualises the security events related to your use case, making it easy to spot trends and anomalies.
4. Test and refine: Actively test your rules to minimise false positives and ensure high detection accuracy. Document the detection logic and the refinement process.
Side Project Option 2: Basic Vulnerability Management & Ethical Hacking Report
This project touches upon the proactive "threat hunting" aspect of a Tier 3 SOC Analyst and demonstrates a foundational understanding of ethical hacking. Goal: To scan a vulnerable system, identify vulnerabilities, and provide a clear report with recommended remediation actions. Approximate Time Allocation: Dedicate around 10-15% of your time.

## Steps and Key Learnings:

1. Set up a vulnerable system: Use a purpose-built vulnerable VM like Metasploitable2 or a deliberately misconfigured OS.

2. Perform a vulnerability scan: Use a free or open-source vulnerability scanner (e.g., OpenVAS/Greenbone Community Edition).

3. Analyse findings: Interpret the scan results, prioritise vulnerabilities based on severity, and research their potential impact.

4. Propose remediations: For each high-priority vulnerability, outline concrete steps to mitigate or fix it.

5. Create a vulnerability report: Document the scope, findings, impact, and remediation recommendations. This demonstrates your ability to assess risk and provide actionable security advice.
Making Your Projects Shine Among Candidates
To ensure your projects stand out and effectively showcase your "introspective" and "problem-solving" nature:

- Detailed Documentation: For every project, create comprehensive write-ups. This includes the problem statement, your methodology, the tools used (and why you chose them), challenges encountered, and how you overcame them. Use screenshots, flowcharts, and diagrams to illustrate your work.

- "Why" Not Just "How": Explain your thought process. Why did you choose a particular tool or approach? What decisions did you make, and why? This demonstrates critical thinking.

- Reflect on Learning: Conclude each project with a section on what you learned, how it deepened your understanding of cybersecurity, and how you might apply this knowledge in a professional SOC environment.

- Build a Cybersecurity Portfolio: Host your project documentation (e.g., on GitHub Pages, a personal website, or a blog). This acts as a digital resume where your work speaks for itself. Include a link to this portfolio on your actual resume.

- Networking: Share your projects with industry professionals through online communities or by attending virtual or in-person cybersecurity events. This can lead to valuable feedback, mentorship, and even job opportunities. Given your quiet nature, online forums and dedicated career sites like Dice or NinjaJobs that specialise in cybersecurity roles might be a good starting point
