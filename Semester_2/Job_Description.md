A **Security Operations Centre (SOC) Analyst** is a crucial frontline professional responsible for monitoring, detecting, analysing, and swiftly responding to cyber threats to safeguard an organisation's networks and valuable data. 

## Tasks and Duties

- Morning Briefing: The day begins with a briefing on the previous day's incidents and any ongoing threats. Analysts review logs and alerts to prioritize tasks for the day.

- Monitoring & Alert Response: Monitor security tools to detect and assess alerts, acting as the first line of defense.

- Threat Detection & Investigation: Analyze suspicious activity to identify threats and understand their impact.

- Incident Response: Respond quickly to contain threats and recover systems, including disabling compromised assets.

- Continuous Learning: New threats will always arise and what worked a few months ago might be completely obsolete now. It is important to always keep track on new tech stacks or methods of attacks for day to day success.

## 5 Required Skills or Tools

- SIEM (Security Information and Event Management): Analyzes log data for threats
- EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response): Monitors and protects endpoints

- IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems): Detects and blocks intrusions

- TIP (Threat Intelligence Platform): Tracks emerging threats and IOCs

- SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response): Automates incident response

- Firewalls: Controls network traffic

## 5 Deliverables of an SOC Analyst

- Incident Reports: Detailed documentation of a detected security incident.

- Daily/Weekly SOC Activity Reports: Summarizes security events and SOC activities for a specific period.

- Threat Intelligence Briefs: Short reports highlighting new or emerging threats relevant to the organization.

- Playbooks/Runbooks: Step-by-step guides for handling recurring incidents or alerts.

- Log Analysis & Forensic Reports: Deep-dive reports from investigating suspicious activity.

# Ideal Work Environment Description or Company Type

As a work environment it is important to always have a strong team dynamic and collaboration, or else when it comes to the security of the company you are trying to secure if one minor thing is not communicated it can be mean absolute disaster and data breach. As long each team member is able to properly communicate any issues on a day to day basis and the managers are able to properly delegate then it should be a great success in all areas.

one example of a work environment is with bank of America where yes team work is a must but the sole focus is on internal network, employee, and systems. Its important to get an indepth understanding of company structure so you can properly understand where an attack might occur. This would also mean using customized SIEM software outside the norm more geared towards Bank of America and it's inner workings.

Another example is SecureWorks which is a, Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP), which is a more high paced, and high volume environment often with multiple 24/7 shift rotations. There is a very strict Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for incident response but the SIEM software might be less customized for the institution.

# Work Rigor and Growth Style

There are many types of work rigors and styles, a low rigor might be government jobs where the infrastrucre is more stable with lower incident volume. Also few false positives and longer timelines yet the growth is more vertical in nature.

For medium rigor you might have focus on one organization with focused monitoring, expecting somewhere between 10-30 alerts a day focuing on suspicious logins and ransomware responses. You can probably expect a horizontal growth as you are exposed to different structures and practices.

Last is high rigor where as a MSSP SOC Analyst you have multiple clients expecting 50-100 alerts per shift. It is a high stress level environment to out person and succeed, yet the reward is high as well. Definitely more of a Hybrid Growth as you'll be exposed to a large amount of different attack strategies and corporate structures.
